While I wallow in self-pity of sitting at work, Nathan and Tuan are off tackling new adventures. They have safely made it to Santiago, Chile before embarking on a bus ride across the Andes to Mendoza, Argentina to meet their group.

Dispatchs (from newest to oldest):

12) 3/19/15 &#8211; Chatted with the guys yesterday a bit. They just got done doing a 9 day circuit through Torres Del Paine. Sadly they had to come out a day early due to some knee issues, but all seems well.

11) 3/7/15 &#8211; I spoke with Nate over this morning. They have made their second attempt at Fitz Roy. They tried a 3 day circuit but the weather was poor so came out a day early and then re-did the same hike. This time blue skies and the view looked stunning. Just beautiful. Nate sent me a picture of him taking a polar plunge in the glacial water.

10) 3/2/15 &#8211;  Have been bad about updating. I stopped getting text message so I assumed they weren&#8217;t using the Deloreme, but I forgot they just stopped that service. They are still being tracked. I Skyped with Nate on Friday night while I was driving down to Wolf Creek chasing some powder. They guys are doing great. They are down in Patagonia about to embark on a 3 day backpacking trip around Fitz Roy.

9) The boys are out and alive!!!! I have seen a few pictures of them on the Glacier and it looks truly badass.

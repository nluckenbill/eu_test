We found ourselves at the Aduana counter in a bit of fog. Why had we actually left Colombia? It was a place both of us could call home. We were welcomed as family with open arms. There was just something incredibly infectious about Colombia. However, if we were to ever make it to Patagonia the journey must continue south. We handed in our vehicle import papers and crossed that imaginary line into Ecuador. While Justin was sorting out the Aduana process Mitch was busy mingling with the locals. Within 5 minutes of conversation Mitch’s new friend, Darwin, invited us to  to Otavalo, where he owned a bar, the Red Pub. There were volcanoes to hike, South America´s largest market, and a festival about to start Otavalo Yamor Festival which he compared to Brazil´s carnival. We were sold!

Now to be honest Otavalo in reality is a fairly boring indigenous town with not much happening, but what we witnessed this weekend with the start of the festival was pure mayhem. Saying goodbye to Mitch, Justin decided to stay behind for the festival with a few others from the hostel, Diego (also traveling via motorcycle), and Kiana. The main event of the festival was a parade through town with groups from the surrounding indigenous communities as well as Latin America.

The parade seemed endless. It went on for hours and hours as locals in traditional indigenous attire marched, sang, and danced their way through the city. It was colorful and loud. The music ranged from traditional flute to regatón to Lou Bega´s classic hit Mambo No 5. Our emotions ranged from ¨wow, this is an incredible displays of culture¨ to ¨what does hot chicks in latex suits on motorbikes have to do with indigenous culture¨. The varying floats were all over the place as well and at sometimes seemed to have no significance. With that said, it was extremely entertaining and at some points mildly hilarious. There were thousands of people lining the streets, and the fun just continued on late into the evening.

Again, contrary to what you would imagine of a small indigenous town following the mass of people we stumbled into disco-alley. There were no less than 30 bars, discotecas, and karaoke bars overfilled with people inside and outside. We never even made it into anywhere. Beer in hand, the people watching from strolling the streets was enough to keep us entertained well into the early hours of the morning. Our favorite spectacle was hands down the street-meat cart being ran by 3 8-year old girls, whose mom was sleeping inside the cart comfortably resting on a pile of old egg cartons with her legs dangling outside. It was parenting at it´s finest!

The spectacle continued all weekend long! There was a beauty pageant for the prettiest woman in Otavalo, bullfighting, a swimming race, a 4wd vehicle showcase, and the Saturday market which virtually turned the entire city into a market where one could find anything from the typical artisanal crafts to guinea pigs, rabbits, and chickens.

By Sunday night the city was back to its quiet and boring self. While the festival was amazing it left us wondering one thing. It was supposed to be about the celebration of Chicha and the history of the cultures local to this region, yet we didn´t see a single glass of chicha being solid or drank. But, hey, it was a damn good party!

Itching to get out of Otavalo and into the real Ecuador it was time to explore one of the many volcanos. Justin and Diego set off early towards Volcan Cayambe to camp under the stars and do a little glacier hiking, or at least that was the rough plan. The drive, starting from Cayabme, was to climb up to 15,200 ft. The road leaving town snaked it´s way through lush green farm fields on bone rattling cobblestone streets before turning into smooth hard packed dirt, which gave way to mud. As we continued to climb views of Volcan Cayambe became increasingly beautiful. It was hard to turn a corner without wanting to stop and take a photo.

The last 5 KM became increasingly tough (some of the hardest terrain we´ve ridden) with steep switchbacks up the volcano. It was hard not to scream, hoot, and holler. It was like nothing we´ve experience yet on this trip!

Reaching the final kilometer things began to get impossible. La Tortuga wasn´t jetted for this altitude and kept wanting to stall in the worst of moments. Here Justin was in the steepest section, wheels spinning over slippery rocks, and stalling over and over again. It was 14,712 ft, and he was ready to call it quits! Diego´s KLR wasn´t fairing much better but he at least made it to the flat area up ahead. Diego pushing La Tortuga from behind, and Justin giving her light throttle we made it inch by inch, only to realize the final two switch backs were a combination of volcanic ash and snow.

We attempted to continue forward, only to sink further down. We had given it a valiant effort, but we´d be walking the last 500 ft! Arriving at the Refugio we enjoyed a warm cup of coffee and soaked in the glaciated views of the volcano, or what we could see of it. At this point it was full of clouds, fog, and sideways snow.

Not wanting to leave the bikes unattended we sadly decided camping at the Refugio would not be happening and decided to head back down, if La Tortuga would start? All of that stalling coupled with the freezing temperatures had killed La Tortugas heart and soul. She was dead! 

We wheeled her over the snow patch and to the steep hill Justin struggled so much to get up, put her in 2nd gear and let gravity do the work! Like a champ La Tortuga push started herself and we headed down the volcano eventually being greeted by warm rays of sun drying our cold and damp bodies. We retreated right back to where we started from earlier that day, Otavalo.

In a search to change things up in the scenery department, we headed off to Utah’s Canyonlands Needles district for a breathtaking overnight loop through Lost Canyon and Elephant Canyon. This 13.8 mile overnight backpack encompasses the best scenery the Needles district has to offer.

Allie, Justin and I left Denver on Friday by 5pm. We really lucked out and made great time to Utah. The plan was to setup camp in some disperse camping off of highway 23 and then get up in the morning to finish the rest of the drive to Canyonlands. This plan worked out perfectly and I highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to get to the Moab area for the weekend from Denver. Our dispersed campsite off of highway 23 was on the Mills road about a mile past the dino parking lot on a 4×4 road. We had an impressive car camping spot just under some bluffs that this area is known for. It didn’t take us long to setup camp and drift off to sleep after the 8 hour drive from Denver.

The next morning it was a little rough for everyone to get going because we all were not quite use to the cold weather yet. When we woke up in the tent Justin said it was about 28 degrees in the tent. Not too shabby for November! The drive from our overnight spot to the Squaw Flat trailhead in the Needles area was about 2 hours.

We set off from the Squaw Flat trailhead at about 11am and were immediately greeted with a trail sign that we took a left on the Squaw Flat A trail. We traveled for about a mile before taking another left on the Lost Canyon trail. It was a gorgeous day without a cloud in the sky and from the beginning we were greeted with views for miles. Soon the trail went across its first slickrock. The the orange rock and the deep blue sky made for a picturess hike. Just before lunch we came to the first scramble of the day. It was short scramble up to the pass and the route was clearly marked by cairns. At our lunch spot at the top of the pass we soaked in the warmish fall sun and gazed down into the Lost Canyon. After leaving the lunch spot, we followed along a slickrock rim all the while there were towering bluffs dwarfing us above the rim. After taking our first ladder of the trip, we began our descent into the wash of the canyon floor. In the wash areas especially, we remained vigilant as the trail can be tricky at times to follow but having all three of us keeping an eye out for the next cairn worked for us throughout the trip. Whenever we didn’t see the next cairn ,after walking for a few minutes, we just simply stopped and walked back to last one we saw and then searched for the next cairn from that spot. This process never fails and ensures you and your party won’t get lost.

At about the 5 mile mark, we past the backcountry campsite LC2. This spot looked like a great fall camping spot.  It was right along the river and pinned up against a nice bluff. In hindsight, I’d probably stay there next time over the backcountry campsite LC3. Nevertheless, the Lost Canyon backountry campsite LC3 was a great campsite. We were tucked up off the trail in a ravine surrounded by trees which would be fanticstic in the hotter months.  About 5 minutes before the LC3 site, we had access to water that was in a stream that ran parallel to the trail. Trying out a new idea, dinner consisted of penne, feta and shiitake mushrooms. We forgot to add the mushrooms until the very end so they turned out to to be a little crunchy. Even with crunchy mushrooms, it was a fantastic meal and it was a great relief to the store bought dehydrated meals.

Despite it getting down into the low 20s we all slept fantastic in our 3 season bags. I like to think that by me sharing to pack your excess layers around the inside of their sleeping bags contributed to their excellent moods in the morning. Being that we had about 8 miles to do that day, we set off early.
